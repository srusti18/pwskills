        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring documents on the web. It uses tags to define elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and links, enabling the creation of websites. HTML provides the foundation for web development, facilitating the display and organization of content in browsers.</dd>
      
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used in web development to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It enables the separation of content from design, allowing developers to define styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness. CSS enhances the visual appeal and user experience of websites.</dd>
      
        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
            <dd>
                JavaScript (JS) is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. As a client-side scripting language, it enables dynamic content, interactivity, and asynchronous communication on websites. JS works alongside HTML and CSS, making web pages responsive and engaging. It is also employed on the server side (Node.js) for broader application development.</dd>

        <dt>React Js</dt>
        <dd>

            React.js, developed by Facebook, is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where the content dynamically updates. It uses a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components. React simplifies the development of complex UIs by efficiently managing the state of components and updating the user interface in response to changes. It has become widely adopted for its declarative syntax, virtual DOM, and efficient rendering, making it a powerful tool for building interactive and scalable web applications.</dd>

        <dt>Node Js</dt>
        <dd>Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It enables developers to run JavaScript on the server, facilitating the development of scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests. It is commonly used to build real-time applications, APIs, and server-side applications, providing a unified JavaScript language for both client and server-side development. npm, the Node.js package manager, offers a vast ecosystem of libraries and modules that further enhances Node.js development.</dd>

        <dt>MongoDB</dt>
        <dd>

            MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database system designed to handle large volumes of data in a flexible, schema-free format. It stores data in JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents, allowing for dynamic and scalable data storage. MongoDB is known for its ability to scale horizontally, making it suitable for a variety of applications, including those with high data volumes or dynamic schemas. It is commonly used in web development for tasks like storing user data, managing content, and supporting scalable applications. MongoDB also provides features like replication and sharding for robust data redundancy and distribution across clusters.</dd>
