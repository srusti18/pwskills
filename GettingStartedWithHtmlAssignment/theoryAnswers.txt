4.Write a short note on tag and element with an example?
Sol:
In HTML , tags are fundamental components used to structure and define the elements within a document. Tags are represented by opening and closing brackets (< and >) and enclose content to give it a specific meaning or functionality. Tags are essential for creating the structure of a webpage and instructing web browsers on how to interpret and display the content.


An element in HTML is made up of a pair of tags, along with the content that is enclosed between the opening and closing tags. Elements can be as simple as a single word or as complex as an entire section of a webpage. Each HTML element serves a specific purpose and contributes to the overall structure and presentation of the content.



5.What is Doctype declaration in HTML?
Sol:
DOCTYPE is a declaration at the beginning of an HTML document that specifies the version of HTML in use. It helps web browsers to interpret and render the content correctly. The DOCTYPE declaration is not an HTML tag; rather, it is an instruction to the browser about the version of HTML  being used in the document.
